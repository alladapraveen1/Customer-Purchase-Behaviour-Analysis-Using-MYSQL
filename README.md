📊 Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis Using SQL
🛠 Tools Used:

MySQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations)

Excel / Sheets (for summary reporting)

SQL Developer / Workbench

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchase data to uncover insights related to revenue trends, customer segmentation, product performance, discount behavior, and subscription patterns.

Evaluate the impact of discounts and subscriptions on revenue.

Segment customers based on buying history.

Build insights that help improve marketing strategies and customer retention.

🧩 Key Business Questions Solved

1️⃣ What is the total revenue generated by male vs female customers?

Used aggregations to compare revenue contribution by gender.

2️⃣ Which customers used a discount but still spent more than average?

Filtered high-value discount customers using subqueries.

3️⃣ What are the top 5 products with the highest review ratings?

Ranked products using AVG rating and filtering top 5.

4️⃣ How do Standard vs Express shipping customers differ in average spend?

Compared spend patterns between shipping types.

5️⃣ Do subscribed customers spend more?

Calculated:

  Total revenue
  
  Average purchase amount
  
  Customer count
  Grouped by subscription status.

6️⃣ Which products have the highest discount usage rate?

Calculated discount percentage using conditional aggregation.

7️⃣ Customer Segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

8️⃣ Top 3 Most Purchased Products in Each Category

Used ROW_NUMBER() window function to rank items within each category.

9️⃣ Do repeat buyers (previous purchases >5) subscribe more often?

Compared subscription behavior of loyal repeat buyers.

🔟 Revenue contribution by age groups

Aggregated revenue across predefined age buckets.
